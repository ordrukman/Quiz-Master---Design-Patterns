  question: Which of the following describes the Bridge pattern correctly?
  answers:
  - This pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by
    step approach.
  - This pattern refers to creating duplicate object while keeping performance in
    mind.
  - This pattern is used when creation of object directly is costly.
  - This pattern is used when we need to decouple an abstraction from its implementation
    so that the two can vary independently.
