# Quiz-Master---Design-Patterns
A Quiz Game that focuses on learning Design Patterns in Unity

This project from Udemy course I took is called Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D. I took this course to learn Unity in C# & Code, 2D Video Games for Web, Mac & PC.

The Quiz:

Throughout the quiz, questions about design patterns appear, the user must answer as many correct questions as possible while dealing with a time limit displayed in the orange cake at the top right of the screen. Throughout the qiuz, the score appears at the top left of the player depending on the number of questions he has answered right up to that moment.
Finally, the result screen that the user was able to achieve will be displayed and another qiuz button.
